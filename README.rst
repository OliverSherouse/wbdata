wbdata
======
Wbdata is a simple python interface to find and request information from the
World Bank's various databases, either as a dictionary containing full metadata
or as a `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org>`_ DataFrame.  Currently, wbdata
wraps most of the `World Bank API
<http://data.worldbank.org/developers/api-overview>`_, and also adds some
convenience functions for searching and retrieving information.
