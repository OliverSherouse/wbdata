# wbdata

Wbdata is a simple python interface to find and request information from the
World Bank's various databases, either as a dictionary containing full metadata
or as a [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) DataFrame or series. Currently,
wbdata wraps most of the [World Bank
API](http://data.worldbank.org/developers/api-overview), and also adds some
convenience functions for searching and retrieving information.

Documentation is available at <http://wbdata.readthedocs.org/> .
